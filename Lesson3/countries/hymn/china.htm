    <h2 align="center">National hymn of China</h2>
    <p align="center">
        Three people's principles <br>
The foundation of us. <br>
Using this, we establish the Republic; <br>
Using this, we advance into a state of total peace. <br>
Oh, you, righteous men, <br>
For the people, be the vanguard. <br>
Without resting day or night, <br>
Follow the Principles. <br>
Swear to be diligent; swear to be courageous. <br>
Obliged to be trustworthy; obliged to be loyal. <br>
With one heart and one virtue, <br>
We carry through until the very end... <br>
