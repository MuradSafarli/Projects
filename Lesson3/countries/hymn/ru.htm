    <h2 align="center">National hymn of Russia</h2>
    <p align="center">
        Russia is our sacred state, <br>
Russia is our beloved country. <br>
A mighty will, great glory – <br>
Your dignity for all time! <br>
<br>
Chorus: <br>
Be glorified, our free Fatherland, <br>
The age-old union of fraternal peoples, <br>
Ancestor-given wisdom of the people! <br>
Be glorified, country! We are proud of you! <br>
<br>
From the southern seas to the polar edge <br>
Our forests and fields are spread out. <br> 
You are the only one in the world! You are the only one – <br>
the native land so kept by God! <br>
<br>
Chorus <br>
<br>
A wide scope for dreams and for life <br>
The coming years open to us. <br>
We are given strength by our fidelity to the Fatherland. <br>
So it was, so it is and it will always be so! <br>
